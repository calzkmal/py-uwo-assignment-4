Today there is considerable buying and selling of goods and services that is done online. Examples include Amazon, Shopify and Google Flights. These platforms need to have access to inventory information which may come from multiple vendors. The platforms also need to maintain electronic shopping carts for customers. Electronic platforms typically include data analytics to improve the experience of users.

There is a need for information on inventories and the use of electronic shopping carts for each customer. Items added to or removed from a shopping cart means that inventory needs to be updated.

In this assignment, I developed software that includes the following classes: product, inventory, shopping cart and a product catalog. These are to be in the file assign4.py. Purchases should be reflected in the inventory. Each line of the file consists of the following: product name, price, quantity, and category in that order.
